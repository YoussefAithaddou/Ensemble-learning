# Ensemble-learning

This mini-project is an application and comparaison between Ensemble-learning methods. 

* Uploaded and cleaned Covid-19 Data.
* Built initial RNN model (2 LSTMs of 64 units) to forecast the number of coronavirus cases, achieved MSE =  123.324.
* Performed model optimization with Tensorboard using 36 combination of LSTM and Dense layers.
* Built final model (1 LSTMs of 128 units, 1 Dropout (20%), 1 Flatten and 1 Dense layer) with MSE = 106.181 (Mean error reduction = 14 %).
